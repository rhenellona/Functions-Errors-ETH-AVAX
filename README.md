# Functions-Errors-ETH-AVAX

Simple smart contract project using require, assert, revert statements.

## Description

The SmartContractProject a Solidity smart contract that functions as a arithmetic calculator It is made using the require, assert, and revert statements. 

## Usage/Features

1. Can be used in performing simple arithmetic equations, such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division.
2. Perform arithmetic operations within Solidity smart contracts, enforcing constraints on the input and output values to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
3. It utilizes 3 statements (assert, require, revert) which is used in error handling, by preventing data modifications providing error messages if certain conditions are not met.

### Executing program

* Use any solidity compiler, I used remix IDE.
* Go to solidity compiler, and compile file.
* On the deploy & run transactions panel, click deploy.
* On the deployed contracts panel, you can try and add, multiply, divide, and subtract.

Feel free to perform different arithmetic equations!

### NOTE

* Look for the green check in every transaction that you make, if you see a green check it means that the transaction went through.
